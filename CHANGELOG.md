# Release Notes for YouTube Sync

## 2.1.0 - 2024-11-20

### Added

-   New setting to set a number of months after which the video related Craft entry will not be updated. This is useful for preventing the plugin from updating entries that have been edited by a user a long time after the initial sync, speeding up the sync process.

-   Closing entries for videos that no longer exist on YouTube now occurs within one job instead of a job per entry.
